function H=lpfilter(type,M,N,D0,n)
%LPFILTER computes frequency domain lowpass filter.
%H=lpfilter(type,M,N,D0,n) creates the transfer function of a lowpass
%filter, H,of the specified type and size (M-by-N).To view the filter as an
%image or mesh plot,it should be centered using H=fftshift(H).

% Valid values for type,Do,and n are:
% 'ideal'    Ideal lowpass filter with cutoff frequency D0.n need not be
%            supplied.D0 must be positive.
% 'btw'      Butterworth lowpass filter of order n, and cutoff D0. The
%            default value for n is 1.0.D0 must be positive.
% 'gaussian' Gaussion lowpass filter with cutoff (standard deviation) D0. n
%            need not be supplied. D0 must be positive.
%  H is of floating point class single .It is returned uncentered for
%  consistency with filtering function dftfilt.To view H as an image or
%  mesh plot, it should be centered using Hc =fftshift(H).

% Use function dftuv to set up the meshgrid arrays needed for computing the
% required distances.
[U,V] =dftuv(M,N);
 
% Compute the distances D(U,V).
D = hypot(U,V);

% Begin filter computation.
